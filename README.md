# BRIT (Backup the Really Important Things)

Litte tool with Qt GUI for backing up dedicated directories and files to zip files.

I start this project mainyl as an excercise in Python. I folow this goals:
- Lean more about Python
- Learn more about Qt
- Leand more about gitbuh
- Get a tool for saving some files

On the idea of BRIT

Its not a real backup tool (there are a lot better tools for this around). The proble I weant to solve is the folowing:

I need no full backup of my laptop: All relevant things are normally on the network (either in the company or in the cloud of in on my private NAS). So when the disk crashes everything can be retrieved somehow.
But there are a few small things, that are not on the network and that I would like to have at a save place.
For example, I need not backup my browser, but I want to backup my favorites list. Another example is the configuration of Total Commander (a tool I use all the time).
